NOTES

DosUnix is actually a pair of programs: dosunix and unixdos, which
perform conversion of line breaks between DOS text files and Unix text
files.  Note that files given as arguments are assumed to be text files.

ChkTxt is a third program supplied with the DosUnix suite, which is used
to identify which text format a given file is in.
